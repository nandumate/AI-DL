AI & Deep Learning Assignments:


This repository contains implementations of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and projects. These assignments showcase fundamental concepts in AI, search strategies, constraint satisfaction, and neural network architectures for different applications.

AI Assignments


1.Implement DFS and BFS for the 8-Puzzle Problem=
Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem, a sliding tile puzzle used to demonstrate state-space search techniques.

2.Implement Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)=
Develop an algorithm to solve constraint satisfaction problems, which involve finding a solution that satisfies a set of constraints or rules.

3.Family Tree Parsing Using a Knowledge Base=
Perform parsing of a family tree structure using a knowledge base, identifying relationships such as parent, child, sibling, etc., through logical inference.

4.Implement A Algorithm for an Application*=
Implement the A* search algorithm, a popular heuristic-based search technique, for solving an application-based problem.

5.Implement Minimax Algorithm for Game Playing
Develop the Minimax algorithm, widely used in decision-making for adversarial games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, or Connect 4.

6.Basic Search Strategies: 8-Queens Problem=
Implement basic search strategies such as backtracking to solve the 8-Queens problem, where 8 queens must be placed on a chessboard without attacking each other.

7.Implement Forward Chaining Algorithm=
Create an inference engine using the forward chaining technique for knowledge-based systems, where data leads to conclusions by applying known rules.

8.Implement Backward Chaining Algorithm=
Implement backward chaining, a goal-driven inference technique, to deduce whether a hypothesis is true based on known rules and facts.

9.Chatbot Application for a Real-World Scenario=
Design and implement a simple chatbot application that interacts with users and simulates a conversation for a specific real-world scenario (e.g., customer support, travel booking).
